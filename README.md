# Earthquakes
A simple responsive html page using google maps api and bootstrap, which shows the different earthquakes around the world along with the year and the damage caused.

Google maps api was used for illustrating the earthquakes with markers of varying colours (based on the damage caused by the earthquakes) and marker clusters. The webpage is also responsive with the help of bootstrap.

The earthquake data is stored in javascript format in assets/data/damage.js and is processed by the assets/scripts/worldmap.js script. The simple css accompanying th html file can be found at assets/css/style.css
