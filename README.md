**Google maps api** is used for illustrating the earthquakes with markers of varying colours (based on the damage caused by the earthquakes) and marker clusters. The webpage is also responsive with the help of bootstrap.

The earthquakes data is stored in javascript format in assets/data/damage.js and is processed by assets/scripts/worldmap.js script. The simple css accompanying the html file can be found at assets/css/style.css.
