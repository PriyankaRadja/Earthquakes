					<h3> General Information </h3> 

					<p> The earthquakes data was cleaned after obtaining from the source. The cleaned earthquakes data can be found at assets/data/damage.js. The worldmap.js found in the assets/scripts directory processes the earthquakes data from damage.js to plot on a world map. The simple css accompanying this html project can be found at assets/css/style.css. 
					</p>

					<h3> World Map</h3>
					<p> The map is displayed with the help of Google maps api. 
					A single marker represents an individual earthquake incident. Marker clusterer is employed to group multiple earthquakes in close proximity into a single icon. On zooming into the marker cluster, the individual earthquakes are displayed by a single marker for each. The country, year and damage information is extracted from the damage.js file to be displayed as the popup text of each marker. InfoWindow property from google maps api is used to acheive this.

					<h3> General CSS </h3>

					<p> The simple CSS accompanying this html page employs background color to differentiate the sections in the html page. Font colours are also modified to employ contrast in the page. Span poperty was used to apply inline colour properties to the text below the map, which mentions that different colours were used to indicate the intensity of the eathquakes by their respective markers.
					</p>

					<h3> Map Styling </h3>
					<p> The map type was set to terrain. The colour of the markers, representing each earthquake, is determined by the intensity of the earthquake, in terms of the damage caused. This is carried out in worldmap.js, where an earthquake which caused a damage of less than $1000 M is assigned a pale red colour for its marker. An earthquake with damage more than $1000 M but less than $30000 M is assigned a medium red colour for its marker and the rest are assigned a dark red.
